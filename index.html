      So as I said I am a big fan of coing or doing anything in tech my class is actually a paperless class so we do everything on a computer and I have been doing coding for over a year now so you can say I know my stuff. Not only does coding make me a better problem solver but it also teaches me patience, perseverance, and discipline. Coding pushes me outside of your comfort zone in a good way!Just like architecture, which is an art used by people daily and affects their everyday life, so is code. I can create something and people interact with, use, touch and work with. That is an amazing feeling that people can actually touch and play and have fun with my work. Coding is one of the best skills to have Problem solving and logic are the main two. Learning to code is like an exercise session for the “left” side of the brain.
